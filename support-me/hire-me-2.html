<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<ul>
  <li>An upfront payment of half of the full price is required. Arguing with me, attempting to haggle on the price or requesting the lines first will result in being blocked.</li>
  <li>You may NOT use my voice to slander me by making me say something that will get me into trouble.</li>
  <li>You may NOT hire me for porn. This will instantly get you blocked.</li>
  <li>You may NOT use samples of my voice for anything porographic or illegal (ie. Using my voice in the background of snuff videos). You will be reported.</li>
  <li>If your only reason to hire me is to be transphobic, homophobic, insult me or all of the above. You will be blocked.</li>
  <li>You may NOT post DMs with me on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChoosingBeggars/">r/choosingbeggars</a> or anywhere else in an attempt to claim that my prices are unreasonable or that I’m scamming you.</li>
  <li>Begging for free work will immediately get you blocked. I don’t care if little Timmy needs his funny lines. You pay me, or you’re not getting anything from me.</li>
  <li>Screaming at me to hurry up will not make me hurry up. In fact, I might charge you extra for that.</li>
  <li>Hiring me just to request a refund is strictly forbidden. If you hire me and don’t like my lines, You will NOT get a refund. Continuing to ask for a refund or posting me online as a scammer will get you blocked and reported.</li>
  <li>You may NOT use my voice to put it into an AI text to speech. You do NOT have the legal right to do this.</li>
  <li>Mocking me for “Not being professional” and “costing way too much for an amateur” will get you blocked. You get what you pay for.</li>
  <li>Crediting me is not required but EXTREMELY appreciated. Please credit me in your video/game or other project as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{character} - https://pikakid98.github.io/</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Jordan Robson/Pikakid98 - https://pikakid98.github.io/</code> also works. But if I get a name change, I may request you to change this to my new name and/or a new website. Refusal to do so will result in a request to take the video down or remove my lines from the game.</li>
  <li>Using my existing voice samples and/or new ones for the purpose of YouTube Poops is allowed (Unless the YTP is made specifically to mock me.. In a serious way, I mean). But please credit me.</li>
  <li>If you send me lines filled with offensive language (aka. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N****r</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Fa***t</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Tr***y</code>) you will INSTANTLY be blocked.</li>
  <li>Sending me an infected file in an attempt to scam me will result in blocking and reporting</li>
</ul>

<p>By submitting a request for voice work, you agree that I will partially own the legal rights to my voice. And if I request to no longer be associated with you, you MUST comply and remove my voice lines and name all together.</p>
